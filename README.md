# Stanford CS234 RL

Welcome to my repository for the Stanford University course CS234: Reinforcement Learning (RL). This course delves into the fascinating realm of RL, a machine learning paradigm focused on training agents to make optimal decisions in dynamic environments.

CS234 equips students with a strong foundation in RL theory, covering essential topics such as Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo methods, and Temporal Difference learning. The course emphasizes practical application through coding assignments and a final project, exploring both classical and cutting-edge deep RL techniques.

## About Me

I am not a Stanford student but a self-learner passionate about Reinforcement Learning. I have followed the course through the lectures available on YouTube, uploaded in 2019. You can find the lecture playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u). Additionally, I have utilized the course materials from the official course website, which you can access [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2023/index.html).

## Course Material

This course closely follows the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (2nd edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Understanding this book is crucial for grasping the concepts taught in CS234. I will be creating another repository dedicated to this book, where I will include all important notes and resources. Stay tuned for the link to that repository.

## Additional Resources

To further enhance your understanding of Reinforcement Learning, I highly recommend the RL Course by David Silver. You can find the playlist for his lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-).
